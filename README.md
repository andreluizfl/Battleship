# Battleship
A simple Battleship board game written in C with Allegro5.2 Library

Compliled with MingW-64
Package Allegro in https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-allegro?repo=mingw64

For Allegro installation do following cmd

"pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-allegro"

Doest need install Allegro, because the library it locally copied and CodeBlocks project already link it properly


It's just a simple project that I made for fun, this is not intend to be a professional application. Any bug plz contact me.
